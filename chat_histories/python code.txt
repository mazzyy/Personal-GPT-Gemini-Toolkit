AI: To manage Python environments, you can use `virtualenv` or `venv` which is built into Python 3. Here are some basic commands:

1. **Create a new environment:**

Using `virtualenv`:
```bash
virtualenv env_name
```

Using `venv` (Python 3):
```bash
python3 -m venv env_name
```

2. **Activate the environment:**

On Windows:
```bash
env_name\Scripts\activate
```

On Unix or MacOS:
```bash
source env_name/bin/activate
```

3. **Deactivate the environment:**

Regardless of your operating system:
```bash
deactivate
```

4. **List installed packages in the current environment:**
```bash
pip list
```

5. **Install a package:**
```bash
pip install package_name
```

Remember to replace "env_name" with the name you want to give to your environment, and "package_name" with the name of the package you want to install. 

Please note that you should have `virtualenv` or `venv` installed and Python installed and properly set in your PATH.
